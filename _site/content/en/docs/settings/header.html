<h3 id="sticky_header">Sticky_header</h3>

<p>When you choose CSS ‘sticky’ header refers to a type of header element that maintains its position on the screen while scrolling, up until a specified point where it becomes fixed.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cta:
  active: false
  title: Get started
  link: /get-started/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="preheader">Preheader</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>preheader: 
  active: false
  is_light: false
</code></pre></div></div>
