<p>Breadcrumb paths are a single line of links (often placed above the title) that show a page’s location in the site hierarchy. Every website should have breadcrumbs, as it benefits SEO as well as the users understanding of the sites structure. See in action on the <a href="/elements/">Elements page</a>. To show the breadcrumbs, write the following ‘code’:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre></div></div>
