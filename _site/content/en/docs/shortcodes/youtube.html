<p>Youtube is a popular video streaming service ( from a company that is known for tracking and profiling, though). The solution is to host the poster yourself and link it to Youtube. This can be done using this shortcode.</p>

<p>You can see it in action on the <a href="/elements/">Elements page</a>. To show a Youtube video embed, write the following ‘code’:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 
</code></pre></div></div>
