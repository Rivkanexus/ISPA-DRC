<p>It is always nice (and good for conversion) to show a ‘Call to action’ on your page (a short text, leading to a button and a related image). An example of such a ‘Call to action brick’ can be found in the footer of this page. It is the block titled ‘Get started with Hugobricks today!’.</p>

<h3 id="use-this-brick">Use this brick</h3>

<p>You probably want the CTA brick to be the same on every page. You can stack the brick on top of other bricks, which is explained in the <a href="/docs/bricks/">Bricks page</a>. If you want the brick to be the same on every page you can use this brick by writing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="content-in-contentenbricksctamd">Content in content/en/bricks/cta.md</h3>

<p>The content of the brick should be stored in the file ‘cta.md’ in the ‘content/en/bricks/’ folder. Note that the filename is equal to the name of the brick (withouth ‘brick_’). This file should look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: cta
---

<h3 id="page-specific-content">Page-specific content</h3>

<p>If you want your content to be different on a specific page, you can override it by placing your custom content in between the opening and closing tag of the brick, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

... page specific content here...


</code></pre></div></div>
