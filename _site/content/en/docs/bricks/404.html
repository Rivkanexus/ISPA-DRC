<p>Having a nice 404 (page not found) page is always nice. This brick provides one. You can see it in action on the <a href="/404/">custom 404 page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="use-this-brick">Use this brick</h3>

<p>You can stack the brick on top of other bricks, which is explained in the <a href="/docs/bricks/">Bricks page</a>. If you want the brick to be the same on every page you can use this brick by writing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre></div></div>

<!---->

<h3 id="content-in-contentenbricks404md">Content in content/en/bricks/404.md</h3>

<p>The content of the brick should be stored in the file ‘404.md’ in the ‘content/en/bricks/’ folder. Note that the filename is equal to the name of the brick (withouth ‘brick_’). This file should look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: 404
---

![](/uploads/illustrations/cuate/error.svg)

# Oops! Something went wrong!


</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="page-specific-content">Page-specific content</h3>

<p>If you want your content to be different on a specific page, which is unlikely in this case, you can override it by placing your custom content in between the opening and closing tag of the brick. This looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

... page specific content here...


</code></pre></div></div>
