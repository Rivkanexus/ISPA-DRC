<p>A map is basically <a href="/uploads/map2.png">an image</a> with a marker on top of it. The marker can be found in the ‘/static/img/’ directory. Make sure to make your map image large enough, as it does not scale. The minimum size is a 900x400 pixel image. You can see the map shortcode in action on the <a href="/elements/">Elements page</a>. To show the map in your content, write the following shortcode:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre></div></div>
