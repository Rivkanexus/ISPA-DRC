## Join the Membership

To become a member of the ISPA-DRC, the following steps must be taken:

- Co-founders are automatically counted as co-founding members of ISPA-DRC;
Internet service providers are called upon to subscribe to the statutes and internal regulations of the ISPA-DRC by completing the membership form after sending a request to the ISPA-DRC or after being contacted by ISPA-DRC.
- Persons interested in the development of the Internet industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo can become member or honorary members by contacting ISPA-DRC through the management committee, which, after examining the applications, will give its opinion in relation to their subscriptions to the statutes and internal regulations of the ISPAD-DRC that will be sanctioned by the completion of the membership forms; however, candidates for membership must be sponsored by an effective member.
- In some cases, ISPA-DRC may contact legal or natural persons for the reasons of their possible membership, which will be sanctioned by completing the membership forms as proof of their subscriptions to the statutes and internal regulations.
