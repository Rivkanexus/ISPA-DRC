# African Peering and Interconnection Forum (AfPIF) 2024

### ISPA-DRC is the local host for the African Peering and Interconnection Forum (AfPIF) 2024. The event will take place from 20 to 22 August 2024 at the Hilton Hotel in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)

AfPIF is an annual conference that aims to promote the development of national and cross-border interconnection and offers the African technical community a unique opportunity to showcase interconnection challenges and opportunities. It focuses on Internet interconnection dynamics, content distribution, and transit obstacles at local and regional levels.

AfPIF aims to foster peering and networking opportunities by providing a forum where key players- infrastructure and service providers, IXPs, regulators, and policy makers can engage in a relaxed but business-like environment, sharing their experiences and learning from experts in the field.
