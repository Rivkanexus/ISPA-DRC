# RDC-IX

## The RDC-IX Project

The RDC-IX project is the modern infrastructure of New Information and Communication Technologies contributing to the implementation of associative and neutral exchange points (IXPs) across the different cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This project will allow local traffic between Internet operators located in the same city to remain local and also traffic between Internet operators scattered throughout the different cities of the country to remain national; thus avoiding the multiple satellite jumps that these operators are currently experiencing to exchange content. In addition, RDC-IX will become the natural hosting location of a host of other services that will reduce bandwidth requirements while improving speed, quality of services, reliability and also contributing to the reduction of the digital distortion so decried as a brake on participation in the process of modernity. In current and medium terms, the points of Internet KINIX (KINshasa Internet eXchange), GOMIX (GOMa Internet eXchange) and LUBIX (LUBambashi Internet eXchange) will constitute the framework of RDC-IX

1. Institutional and Operational Models

RDC-IX has subscribed to the "association of non-profit ISPs" model. As such, RDC-IX will be equipped with permanent staff. RDC-IX remains a non-profit organization and remains owned by all its members grouped within ISPA-DRC. It should be noted that the network activities of RDC-IX members include the transmission of content and services from third parties.
Technically, RDC-IX will work under layer 2. In this model, each member provides their own router and the exchange is done via the switch. RDC-IX opts for multilateral peering.

2. Objectives

- Location of Internet traffic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
- The use of technologies such as "BGP V4; "MPLS"; "IPv6"; "I Multicast" and Support for local content development
- The implementation of a secure model based on CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) technology
The establishment of a point of convergence of local and international exchanges

3. Cost

There is a difference between the connection cost paid once and a monthly or quarterly membership fee, for the maintenance and monitoring of equipment. The various costs related to the connection to the RDC-IX are the responsibility of each member.
