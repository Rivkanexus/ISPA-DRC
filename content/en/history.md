The Internet Service Provider Association of the Democratic Republic of Congo (ISPA-DRC) operates as a non-governmental entity under Congolese law, emerging from the collective desire of Internet sector professionals to utilize their knowledge and experience in the Internet arena to advance information and communication technologies (ICT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The goals of ISPA-DRC are encapsulated in the enhancement of labor productivity through the effective use and dissemination of computer tools, leading to the socio-economic progress of the country. ISPA-DRC's role is to advocate for the interests of Internet service providers and to promote innovative Internet services. Currently, its members represent more than 85% of the total Internet connections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ISPA-DRC's initiatives are implemented throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo and wherever its interests are applicable. The organization is in the process of forming a working group to tackle various issues, such as:

- Aspects of telecommunications regulation;
- Legal considerations in the profession;
- Technical aspects.

In addition, ISPA-DRC also examines matters related to the management of specific issues or exceptional projects in the Internet domain.
