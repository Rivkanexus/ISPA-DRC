<p>If you want to show the latest (blog) posts on your website, you can use the posts brick. This requires you to use the following markup:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: Page title
---




# Blog posts

This is a demo of the blog. In ultricies vel enim vel pulvinar. Quisque finibus sem velit, sed consequat mi ullamcorper vitae. Proin finibus tristique sollicitudin.


</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that this requires you to have a directory called ‘posts’ in ‘content’. In this folder you need to store your posts as markdown files.</p>
